## Supporting 

If you'd like to read the GraphQL Guide, and if you can afford to purchase it or if your company reimburses you for educational materials (most do 👍), we would value your support: [https://graphql.guide](https://graphql.guide).

## Chapter 6

Numbered branches (`0` and up) have the most up-to-date code (often newer than the most recent published revision of the book). When code has changed between book revisions, a new code version is created, and each branch is tagged, with the naming format `[step]_[version]`. For instance, version `r1` of the book was published with version `0.1.0` of this repo, so the tag for step 5 was [`5_0.1.0`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/releases/tag/5_0.1.0).

Thank you to everyone who has contributed 😃🙌

## Contributing

We welcome issues and PRs! For large changes, we recommend opening an issue first to get feedback before putting in the work of a PR. Minor things like typo fixes can go directly to PRs and will usually get a quick response 😊

When editing code that's part of the book, submit the PR to the corresponding step branch (eg branch `3` for step 3) instead of to `master`.
